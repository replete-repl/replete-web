# Replete Web 

#### https://replete-repl.org/repl/

##### A ClojureScript web app with a self-hosted eval REPL.

It is compliant with 1.10 features and bundled with the following commonly used namespaces:

- clojure.core.reducers
- clojure.data
- clojure.reflect
- clojure.set
- clojure.string
- clojure.walk
- clojure.zip
- clojure.test.check
- cljs.pprint
- cljs.reader
- cljs.spec.alpha
- cljs.spec.gen.alpha
- cljs.spec.test.alpha
- cljs.test

### Usability features:
Like the native Replete family REPLs it supports a simple, clean interface with
- `parinfer` editing to simplify form entry  
- command history (via Cmd/Ctrl up/down arrows)

# Contributing

# Development

## Starting REPLETE in Development - with Figwheel

Start a development REPL / Browser session

```bash
clojure -A:fig-repl

[Figwheel] Compiling build replete to "resources/public/js/compiled/app.js"
[Figwheel] Successfully compiled build replete to "resources/public/js/compiled/app.js" in 6.961 seconds.
...
ClojureScript 1.10.520
cljs.user=> 
```

The REPLETE web UI will be served and you can interact / dev / test

## Starting REPLETE in Development - without Figwheel

Start a development REPL / Browser session

```bash
$ clojure -A:repl
Watch compilation log available at: resources/public/js/compiled/out/watch.log
ClojureScript 1.10.520
cljs.user=> 
```

The REPLETE web UI will be served and you can interact / dev / test

**NOTE**: this REPL do not use _figwheel_ so you will need to manually refresh the page to obtain changes to behaviour.

### Local HTTP via Python

```bash
cd resources/public
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888
```

Open `http://localhost:8888` in your browser

`Ctrl-C` will stop the server


### Local HTTP via Docker

Assuming you have Docker all set up and running . . .

#### Starting the docker container

```bash
./run-prod-docker.sh
